# Intro

# Background

# Bayesian Surprise

# Surprise mapping

## Demo

### England LADs

TODO

- prior is global
- calculate likelihood and posterior for each LAD on burglary
- calculate KL divergence between prior and posterior for each LAD on burglary

### London Boroughs

TODO

- prior is global
- calculate likelihood and posterior for each Borough on burglary
- calculate KL divergence between prior and posterior for each Borough on burglary

## Emerging areas

TODO

- prior is local - how to deal with seasonality (maybe we don't - because it's relative difference between them - and police resources are constant... )
- calculate likelihood and posterior for each Borough on burglary
- calculate KL divergence between prior and posterior for each Borough on burglary

### Optimal amount of months to use for prior

TODO
- refer to airbnb

# Conclusions
